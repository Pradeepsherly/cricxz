             <span ><b>Why IPL is special among other T20 leagues</b></span> <br>
             <p class = "cth"> Cricket, until in its everlasting history, had never exhibited the term called a franchise-based league till the inception of the IPL in 2008. Yes prior to the IPL’s arrival there were few tournaments and T20 competitions being played but the concept of corporations and individuals owing a cricket team was completely alien in the game’s entire existence.

             While owning a team in other sports like football was very common at that time, watching a cricket player, whether international or uncapped, getting auctioned and fetching a price in millions was a dazzling phenomenon that the game had never experienced.
             Over the years, with its unique set of arrangements and exhibitions, the IPL is now one of the top-notch sporting events happening in the realm of sports, and in cricket, it is the second most cherished event only behind the ICC Cricket World Cup.

             Although, the IPL was the first T20 tournament that exhibited the above-mentioned concepts of player auctions and franchise-based ownerships, in today’s age there’s now a profusion of T20 leagues working on such ideas and conceptions.
             
             Other quality leagues like the BBL and the PSL happen at a time when cricket is played at its peak in the southern hemisphere. International teams like Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand do plan their home international fixtures at that time period, hence eliminating their frontline players to fully participate in such leagues. Even the presence of Asian players is highly elusive because of the winters at that phase wherein some overseas teams or others are seen touring the sub-continent.
             One of the underlying uniqueness of the IPL for over the years has been the time of the year in which it’s been played. Other major T20 Leagues like the BBL, PSL, and CPL do mainly clash with other prime international cricket fixtures and that’s the reason why it misses the participation of the elites. In CPL’s case, it’s mainly played when the English cricket summer sites itself towards its second half, and the subcontinent teams mainly India either prepares for its home season or are seen mainly touring.

        <span ><b>Future plans of ODI cricket</b></span> <br>
        <p class = "cth">Test Cricket is only played by a handful of cricket-playing nation at the highest level. The 50 over format has lost lot of its fans to the shortest format in the recent times and empty stands for a One day international is proof of it. With the T20 format gaining huge popularity over the Test format, (if not already happened) it is just a matter of time when T20 format will be the most preferred format in cricket.
        Cricket will evolve drastically in the coming years to compete with other global sports as Cricket for a long time has been termed a colonial sport and need to be positioned amongst global sport especially with its current popularity.

        The game will evolve as a spectator sport and changes in the format, technology used will improve drastically along with change of rules making the game faster and more exciting.
   
        The One Day International (ODI) format may undergo a drastic change as the current form of ODI is rapidly losing its fan base and boring at times even for the fans of the game.

       The greatest ODI player in the history of the game, Sachin Tendulkar also had suggested that the One-day Internationals will be difficult to coexist with the T20 format and will need drastic change in the rules. One of his suggestions was to spilt the game into two innings and play it like a shortened format of the test.
       believe that the above change can threaten Test Cricket.

       Due to the colonial mindset, change is not easy to be accepted in the game of cricket and while T20 format was successful and an exception to this rule, ICC may have to be bold in their decision making if ODI survives in the long run.
       Rules have been tweaked in the recent past to accommodate the changing needs of the game. This is unusual as the game was always played in a traditional manner. But with time, cricket has undergone change to accommodate the growing need. Rules like Impact player was introduced in the recently concluded Indian Premier League 2023 and many rules especially in the shorter format may be brought to keep the audience glued to the television set.

       The laws of the game also may undergo change to avoid the monotony in the game. The mode of dismissal or the run scoring methodology may also see some change
       
       ICC will need to keep a close eye on other field sports especially European sports to see if they can adopt certain rules from their game.

        <span ><b>Cricket included in olympics 2028</b></span> <br>
        <p class = "cth">The addition of cricket in the Olympics, for the first time since 1900, concludes a two-year process, in which the ICC worked extensively to develop an exciting proposal that supports the Olympic values and LA28’s mission to create an unparalleled experience for athletes, fans, partners and the local community.

        The Olympic Games is estimated to have an audience of more than 3 billion viewers across TV and digital platforms, representing a unique opportunity for cricket to engage new audiences and further boost the sport’s reach across the world, opening the door to a new generation of cricket enthusiasts.
        
        Reflecting on the news, ICC Chairman Greg Barclay commented, "We are thrilled that cricket’s inclusion in the LA28 Olympic Games has been confirmed by the IOC Session today. To have the opportunity to showcase our great sport at the LA28 Games and hopefully many Olympic Games to come will be great for players and fans alike. 
        While it didn't feature in the original list of 28 sports finalised by the IOC last February, cricket's efforts to be part of the Olympics received a significant boost last July when it was added to a shortlist of nine to be reviewed by the IOC for addition. It was originally vying for a spot alongside baseball/softball, flag football, lacrosse, break dancing, karate, kickboxing, squash and motorsport.


During its presentation in front of LA28, the ICC recommended a six-team T20 event for both men and women. The participating teams would comprise the top-six ranked sides in the ICC's men's and women's T20 rankings on a cut-off date. The ICC proposed the T20 format as the best format since both LA28 and the IOC had emphasised that the format should be one in which there is a world championship conducted (which ruled out the T10 format, for example), has a compact duration (which ruled out ODIs) and had significant spectator interest.

It could not be confirmed if the ICC had finalised a tournament structure, which until recently was still under discussions.

A sport that is played by nearly half the world's population, cricket has featured only once in the global games, 128 years before the proposed event at LA 2028. In Paris 1900, just one game was played where Great Britain pipped hosts France to the gold medal. On that occasion, the game was played over two days and consisted of four innings like a first-class fixture.

        <span ><b>Evlouation of women's cricket</b></span> <br>
       <p class = "cth"> Cricket has traditionally been seen as a “male” sport, despite the fact that women have played the game for just as long as men.

In 1963, England captain Len Hutton famously said during a charity match against a women’s side that women playing cricket was “absurd, like a man trying to knit” (the women went on to win the match). Views like Hutton’s were once common, which has meant that women have often been absent from official histories of the game.

This exhibition aims to help correct that absence by documenting some of the many examples of women’s contribution to cricket, and by tracking the history of their participation. In 2018, MCC acquired the archive of the Women’s Cricket Association, which has helped to inform the displays seen here.
        The evolution of women’s cricket has seen significant changes in rules, format, and playing style.

Initially, the rules for women’s cricket were the same as for men’s cricket, but several modifications were made to suit the needs and abilities of female cricketers over time. For example, the length of women’s cricket matches was reduced to accommodate the players’ fitness levels.

In terms of format, women’s cricket has seen a lot of experimentation and innovation. The introduction of the Twenty20 (T20) design has been a game-changer, offering more exciting and fast-paced matches, which has helped to increase the sport’s popularity among women. The recent introduction of the Hundred formats has also received positive reviews.
The playing style of women’s cricket has also evolved. Women’s cricket has become more professional and competitive, with players focusing on improving their skills and techniques. Batting and bowling styles have become more aggressive, leading to higher scores and more entertaining matches.

In conclusion, the evolution of women’s cricket has been a journey towards making the sport more accessible, exciting, and professional for female cricketers. The changes in rules, format, and playing style have helped to grow the sport and increase its popularity among fans and players.
